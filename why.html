        <h2>Why I prefer Dogs over Cats</h2>
        <article>
            <p>The reason I prefer dogs over cats is because I think they are more affectionate compared to cats. Not only that but dogs also seem more playful which is very good for me specifically since I would rather them be like that then cats which I think just sit around your house.</p></article>
